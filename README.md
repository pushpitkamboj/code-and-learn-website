# code-and-learn-website
WHAT PROBLEM DOES IT SOLVE:
I was always thinking that the AI tools in the past few years have grown in the market which is very good but the issue is that people unfamiliar with the tech industry don't know to use these tools, so I thought to provide a platform where the tools are listed with there use cases and some tutorials how to use them.

MY MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROJECT:
I am very interested in learning about AI and how maths and computer science come together to build something great like it. I started with Python and thought to build a website with the help of Python so choose Flask framework with HTML and CSS for styling purposes.

WHAT DID I LEARN:
I learned to work with API and how to create them, in the process I also learned how can we deploy our project from Github to the real world, I have deployed my project with the help of Render an online platform.
I have also used an online IDE called Replit to see the simultaneous effect on the website upon changing the code.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT:
it is very simple if you found any issue surely raise it, and if you want to add some more features to the website you are surely welcome to do, in case you want to reach out to me you can email me at :
